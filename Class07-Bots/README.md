# Class 7 -  Bots

## APIs and Authentication

Last class we learned about APIs, but this week we'll be dealing with more complex APIs that require **authentication**. Authentication typically means there are a few extra steps before you can start using the API, sometimes it takes a few minutes but the verification process can sometimes take up to a few days. However, without learning how to use an API with an authentication process, you'll miss out on some of the more exciting APIs out (Twitter, Facebook, Youtube, Instagram, etc).

So what is the API authentication process? It confirms who you are (ie the client). By verifying that you are in fact who you say you are, companies can help prevent hacking attempts from cyber criminals snooping around looking to expose any weaknesses in their frameworks. It also allows companies to control who has access to which parts of their data and systems.

We will be dealing with the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework with the Twitter API this class.
