Data can be complex, enormous, and beyond tedious to parse by hand. This is why we need tools, like Python, to help us. Data can be used to determine Twitter trends, [prove biased practices by corporations](https://www.propublica.org/article/minority-neighborhoods-higher-car-insurance-premiums-white-areas-same-risk), and Facebook even used their data to draw out [global migration patterns](https://www.facebook.com/notes/10158928002728415/).

## CSV

The CSV format, or comma separated values, is a format we'll see a lot of when we're working with data. It's the preferred data type for analysis because of how well it works with programs like Python. If an organization says they have open source data, but the format is .txt - or even worse, PDF, it's not as accessible as they may be advertising. You have probably used this format without realizing if you ever used Excel or Google Sheets. These softwares are GUIs (graphical user interfaces) for the CSV format.
