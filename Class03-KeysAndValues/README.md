# Class 3 - JSON & Dictionaries

### JSON

**J**ava**S**cript **O**bject **N**otation - it's 'easy' to read and write for humans (that's debatable) and it's very easy for machines to parse and generate.

JSON text format is the same regardless of if you're using P5, Processing, Cinder, Python, or any other language.

An example of JSON: 

```
{
   "eBooks":[
      {
         "language":"Pascal",
         "edition":"third"
      },
      {
         "language":"Python",
         "edition":"four"
      },
      {
         "language":"SQL",
         "edition":"second"
      }
   ]
}
```
